## Administration & Quality Control

<table class="table-no-vertical-lines" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed;">
<tbody>
<tr><td><b>Child Specific</b></td>
<td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Respondent</b></td>
<td>Primary Caregiver</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Administration</b></td>
<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">The child-specific Infant Sensor Questionnaire surveys were sent automatically to caregivers via their preferred method of contact (email or text message) marked by HBCD Study staff during the visit</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Visits</b></td>
<td>V02, V03</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Quality Control</b></td>
<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">When no survey responses were received, research assistants were contacted to confirm whether the surveys had been sent to participants as intended. The most common cause of missing responses was caregiver non-response, and less commonly due to human error (preferred contact/contact method not selected by RA) or technological malfunction. .</td></tr>

## Instrument Details

The Infant Sensor Questionnaire, developed by the HBCD Workgroup, is a daily survey about infant heart rate and leg movement sensors that capture information about motor behavior, physical activity, and sleep. The survey is sent daily over 3 days while the infant wore heart rate and leg movement sensors to capture context for the recordings. Sent automatically to primary caregivers at 24, 48, and 72 hours, the survey covered the preceding 24 hours, asking if sensors were worn consistently and gathering information on daily activities (e.g., typicality of the day; nap and sleep duration; time spent in car seat, swing, or other restraining device; time in a moving car or stroller; and leg swaddling during sleep). See [Pini et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101446) for a full description of this measure.
