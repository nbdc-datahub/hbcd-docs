<p>This form is to understand general patterns of use and used to complement the TLFB, which asks about specific select weeks of use during pregnancy, and biospecimens, which has variable look back periods. In addition, participants were asked about typical use patterns in each trimester. However, some individuals only consider use after pregnancy recognition as 'pregnancy use', and thus may have discordant responses between this measure, the ASSIST and the TLFB.</p>

<p>This measure was added one year into recruitment. Thus, while most people will have the measure at V2 (<i>note- only if they endorsed substances on the V1 or V2 ASSIST</i>), the first 1200 participants who had passed V2 were offered the measure at their next scheduled assessment, so can appear in any visit after V2.</p>

<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">This measure will need to be complied whenever it was assessed for the original participants. All others after its launch will have the measure at V2. One additional caveat- only people who report alcohol, opioids, cannabis, tobacco or stimulants on the ASSIST during or the 3 months before pregnancy (V1) or the end of pregnancy (V2) are given the instrument.</td></tr>

## Instrument Details

If individuals endorse one of 5 substances on the V1 Assist (3 months before or during pregnancy) or the V2 Assist (end of pregnancy), they will complete the questionnaire only for those endorsed substances. For each substance endorsed, they are asked the type of use (e.g. cannabis- smoked flower, vaped, edibles, etc). They then report, on average for each trimester, on average how many weeks they had use, and for each week, the average number of days they had use. See [Additional Exposure Questions PDF](additional-exp-V2.pdf) for example.
