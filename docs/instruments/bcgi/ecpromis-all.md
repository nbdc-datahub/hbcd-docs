# ecPROMIS
The **ecPROMIS** (Early Childhood Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) is a set of primary caregiver report questionnaires that offer clinicians and researchers a brief, efficient, and precise way to evaluate young children‚Äôs well-being. HBCD includes three ecPROMIS instruments: the Child-Caregiver Relationship Scale, Peer Relationships Scale, and Self Regulation - Flexibility Scale.

<p>The ecPROMIS assesses normative variations in child behavior and should be interpreted within the context of the child's age and developmental stage. This is not clinical or diagnostic instrument.</p> 
<p>The HBCD dataset includes many variables that may be important for sound and comprehensive analysis. The inclusion of additional variables will depend on the research question(s) and methodological approach. Users are encouraged to take time to explore the full range of available variables ‚Äî especially those that may serve as controls, contextual indicators, confounders, mechanisms, or modifiers ‚Äî to ensure thoughtful and well-supported analytic decisions. Other important considerations may include developmental functioning, broader family supports, and early adverse and protective exposures.</p>

## Instrument Details

### ecPROMIS - Child-Caregiver Relationship Scale
The **Child‚ÄìCaregiver Relationship Scale** evaluates the degree to which young children develop close, satisfying relationships with caregivers. It was originally developed to assess children aged 1 to 5 years old. Language adjustments were made for developmental appropriateness for infants and approved by the Health Measures (ecPROMIS) team.

<p><b>General Language Modifications</b><br>
Measure instructions and individual items that reference gendered pronouns (‚Äòhis/hers‚Äô, ‚Äòhe/she‚Äô) were edited to either eliminate the pronouns entirely or replace with ‚Äòmy child‚Äô when eliminating pronouns was not grammatically possible. In contrast to other measures, following consultation with measure creators, the term ‚Äúparent‚Äù was not replaced with ‚Äúparent/caregiver.‚Äù</p>
<p>The wording changes are minimal, should have no effect on data, and were approved by the measure creators. Because ecPROMIS measures are copyrighted, however, it is important that publications account for and note edits made to individual items.</p>

<p>Each of the 5 items for ecPROMIS Child-Caregiver Interaction is answered on a scale of 1-5: 1 (Never), 2 (Rarely), 3  (Sometimes), 4 (Often), and 5 (Always). A sum score is generated when the caregiver answers at least 3 out of the 5 items (<i>ecpromis1, ecpromis2, ecpromis3, ecpromis4, ecpromis5</i>). If caregivers answer 3 or 4 items, a prorated sum score is calculated using the formula: 
<p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
  \[
  \text{Prorated Score} = \left( \frac{\text{Sum of answered items}}{\text{Number of items answered}} \right) \times \text{5}
  \]
</p>
If fewer than 3 items are completed, the sum score is marked as missing.</p>
</div>

### ecPROMIS - Peer Relationships Scale
The **Peer Relationships Scale** assesses young children‚Äôs positive peer interactions, sociability (getting along well with others), and empathic behaviors.

  <p><b>Addition of New Item</b><br>
  The item <code>[peer_yn]</code> was added to the beginning of the survey instrument for HBCD to assess whether the child had opportunities to interact with other children during the primary period (past 7 days).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Item text</strong>: <i>‚ÄúMy child had opportunities to interact with other children."</i><br>
    <strong>Response options</strong>: 0 [No]; 1 [Yes]; Decline to Answer
  </blockquote>
  The addition of <code>[peer_yn]</code> does not affect scoring (as the item isn't scored), but can be used as a filter variable for analyses. This item was added with the approval of the measure creators. However, because ecPROMIS measures are copyrighted, it is important that any publications using this variable note that <code>[peer_yn]</code> was not part of the original measure.</p>

If all four items are answered, their sum is calculated. If at least three items are answered but some are missing, a prorated sum is computed:

### ecPROMIS - Self Regulation - Flexibility Scale
The **Self Regulation - Flexibility Scale** assesses young children‚Äôs ability to adapt in response to environmental demands, changes, and expectations.
