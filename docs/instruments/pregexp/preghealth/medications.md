<p>There are potential issues relating to correct coding medication names from RxNORM. For Pregnancy Health-Medications, no option for preventive use made it difficult to code aspirin use for preeclampsia. Aspirin was specifically moved to the prenatal vitamin section a few months into the study. Some medications were also coded with dose, but this was not asked and should not be used.</p>
