<p>Performance of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fourth Edition, reflects the child's developmental status, but various factors might influence the results of the assessment that should be taken into account.</p>
<p>The test was given in the context of a battery of tests and procedures administered to the child and his/her caregiver during the course of an extended visit. Some children may experience fatigue from this and this may have adversely impacted their performance. Ratings of arousal level of the child before and after the assessment may help in identifying situations where the child may have under-performed.</p>
<p>The child's exposure to different languages may also impact their performance. The Multilingual Language Development questionnaire was used to screen for parental preference for the test to be administered in Spanish or English (<i>Spanish language translations used are available upon request</i>). The instrument also documents other language exposures that the child may have. Exposure to languages other than Spanish or English may impact a child's performance. In addition, some items on the test may be impacted by environmental experiences related to the task or items used. In these cases, the test may underestimate the child's developmental status.</p>

<p>Although the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fourth Edition, is a well-established and validated measure of infant development, tests of this nature have historically had limited predictive validity for long-term neurocognitive status.</p>

    <li>Research assistants (RAs) underwent a training process and were required to submit videos and item scoring responses of an administration for review by trained Bayley administrators who then certified that the RA was compliant with the administration instructions as outlined in the manual.</li>
    <li>For data collection, a QR code was used to enter the child&#39;s study ID number and Date of Birth. Adjustments for prematurity were made using the QR code.</li>
    <li>For data collection, responses were entered into QGlobal during testing and QGlobal aided RAs in determining appropriate basal and ceiling criteria during administration.</li>
    <li>All scoring (addition of item responses) and tabulation of standard scores was done by the QGlobal software.</li>
    <li>Item responses and standard scores were electronically transferred from QGlobal to HBCD.</li>
    <li>Range checks were performed on the data to identify values that were deviant. This was done at the item and cluster level on individual records.</li>
    <li>Mean and range checks were also done on items and summary scores across the overall cohort to assess deviations. These findings informed RA trainings.</li>
    <li>Completion rates were monitored for the overall consortium and at the site level to address any additional training needed.</li>

  <p style="color: red;">Luci note: I've included a suggested update to the QC text. The text above is fantastic internal documentation, but for the website, I think it can be simplified to only include relevant info/details for the end user like so:</p>
  <p>HBCD Study staff were trained and certified by experienced Bayley administrators to ensure adherence to standardized procedures. During testing, responses were entered into QGlobal (Pearson‚Äôs official scoring platform for the Bayley Scales), which automatically applied scoring rules and generated standardized scores. Data underwent quality checks at both the individual and cohort levels, including range and consistency checks, to identify potential errors or deviations. Completion rates were monitored across sites, with additional training provided when needed.</td>

## Instrument Details

The **Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fourth Edition**, is an established, commercially available measure of early development. The test provides an estimate of the child's cognitive, language, and motor skills. The **Language Domain** evaluates both receptive and expressive communication skills. The **Motor Domain** evaluates both fine and gross motor skills. The **Social-Emotional** and **Adaptive Behavior** Scales of the Bayley-4 were not administered in this study. Publisher documentation for the Bayley-4 is available [here](https://www.pearsonassessments.com/en-us/Store/Professional-Assessments/Cognition-%26-Neuro/Bayley-Scales-of-Infant-and-Toddler-Development-%7C-Fourth-Edition/p/100001996).

<p><b>Administration</b><br>
The test was designed to be administered by trained clinicians. For the HBCD Study, however, administration was performed primarily by trained Research Assistants (RAs). HBCD implemented a rigorous training and certification process to ensure that all RAs met study-wide standards before conducting assessments. For <strong>training</strong>, subject matter experts (licensed psychologists with expertise in infant testing and BSID-4 administration) provided lectures, group discussions, and office hours for individualized guidance. <strong>To be certified</strong>, RAs were required to submit both a recorded administration and their QGlobal item-level scoring for expert review.</p>

<p><b>Use of Caregiver Questions</b><br>
The use of Caregiver Questions on the BSID-4 was modified. RAs were instructed to query the caregiver if the child scored below a 2 on items where caregiver input is permitted to inform the assessment. The BSID-4 manual specifies using caregiver reports when the target behavior ‚Äúhas not been observed.‚Äù It also notes that caregiver questions were used in 95% of administrations in the normative sample, with no formal limit on their use. The manual indicates that the assessment‚Äôs validity may be questioned if there are frequent discrepancies between what is observed and what is reported.</p>

<p><b>Accommodations For Spanish-Speaking Households</b><br>
Modifications were made to accommodate Spanish-speaking households. <strong>English instructions were translated by experienced Bayley assessors</strong> accustomed to administering the BSID-4 in Spanish contexts for infants. The <strong>HBCD Spanish Language Committee reviewed translations</strong>, resolving discrepancies through iterative discussion. For families opting for Spanish administration, RAs used the approved HBCD Spanish translations of both instructions and caregiver questions. No modifications were made to the scoring of the responses and computation of the associated cluster and standard scores.</p>
