<p>Acculturation surveys may make some individuals feel excluded or othered. However, this measure aims to capture the process and understand an individual's personal preferences for taking part in their personal family cultural values as well as those of "American" culture.</p>
<p>This measure does not specifically define what "American" should mean, but allows the participant to decide what it means to them.</p>

The VIA is administered only if the caregiver, spouse/partner, or any of the child's grandparents were born outside the U.S. If all are U.S.-born, the survey platform (REDCap) automatically ends the questionnaire after the screening questions. Participants are allowed to choose more than one culture to account for individuals who may live in multicultural households.

## Instrument Details

**Acculturation** is a cultural change that occurs when individuals from one cultural background come into continuous, first-hand contact with another cultural setting. This happens when immigrants emigrate from their heritage culture to a receiving culture, in this case the United States or ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù culture. Acculturation may also happen when second-generation US-born individuals with foreign-born parents experience a family/heritage culture in their home and upbringing that is different from the environmental culture they were born into, in this case ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù culture. This first-hand contact may result in individual changes (i.e., values, attitudes, beliefs, and identities) and group changes (i.e., social and cultural systems). 

The **Vancouver Index of Acculturation (VIA)** measures acculturation orientations, or the way immigrants prefer to relate to the society of settlement (cultural adoption) and country of origin (cultural maintenance). For this study, we use the terms ‚Äúfamily culture‚Äù for a participant‚Äôs heritage/ethnic cultural practices and ‚ÄúAmerican culture‚Äù for cultural practices that are part of mainstream American culture. In VIA, concepts are not unidimensional where an individual can either maintain the culture of origin OR adopt the culture of settlement. The VIA seeks to understand the participant‚Äôs personal preferences for taking part in their family culture as well as those of American culture, if they are different.

Some immigrants may consider American culture as their family culture. They can select ‚Äúnone‚Äù to indicate they do not identify with a culture other than American. We attempted to capture many different countries, ethnicities, and religions for participants to select. However, if a participant‚Äôs family culture is not listed, they can select ‚ÄúNone of these apply/My family culture is not listed‚Äù.

Participants are not to be asked about immigration or documentation status. The intent is that they only answer this survey if they feel comfortable revealing their generational status (first, second, or third generation immigrant) based on the gating questions provided.
