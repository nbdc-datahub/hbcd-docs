    <strong>QC Procedures:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Monthly data consistency checks</li>
            <li>Clarifying contradictory information by sites</li>
            <li>Handling of incomplete or missing responses by sites</li>

    <i>Common issues identified and addressed include:</i>
        <ul>
            <li>Erroneously completed at V1 (which is not possible because the visit occurs during pregnancy)</li>
            <li>Data entry errors (e.g., inconsistencies in site responses where reported answers about whether a transition in care had ‚Äúever‚Äù occurred conflicted with the information recorded in TIC Screeners)</li>
            <li>Multiple forms submitted with conflicting information</li>
            <li>Missing data patterns</li>

## Instrument Details

The **Transitions in Care (TIC) Screener** documents when children spend time living in non-parental care (i.e., change in who provides primary care for the child) and is administered at every time point starting with Visit 2. It is designed to capture children‚Äôs formal and informal transitions to non-parental care, including living in foster care, kinship care, and other non-parental care arrangements, either temporary or permanent. The TIC Screener is completed by a research assistant (RA) at each site at the time of scheduling a participant, usually based on phone calls. Information can be entered into the profile of the child, original consented parent, and/or alternate caregiver.

## INTERNAL NOTES (to remove)

**Updates made by Luci when pulling info from README template:**

Below is info from the README that I interpreted as internal documentation and did not include or updated in the page above:

 - pilot data dictionary excluded
 - I added the text under "Additional Resources" to the Responsible Use Warning
 - **For QC**, I changed "Common Issues Identified:" to "Common Issues Identified and addressed" so that users don't think that these issues will exist in the release data. I also did not include any of the detailed text about potential issues noted by subject matter experts as they were already summarized in the text describing QC issues identified (with a level of detail more fitting/relevant for the end user)
