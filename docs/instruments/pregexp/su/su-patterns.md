<p>This form is to understand general patterns of use and used to complement the TLFB, which asks about specific select weeks of use during pregnancy, and biospecimens, which has variable look back periods. In addition, participants were asked about typical use patterns in each trimester. However, some individuals only consider use after pregnancy recognition as 'pregnancy use,' and thus may have discordant responses between this measure, the ASSIST, and the TLFB.</p>

<p>This measure is administered only if participants endorsed substance use on the V1 or V2 ASSIST. However, because the instrument was added one year after study enrollment began, its availability varies. While most participants first received the measure at V2, early enrollees (~1,200 participants) who had already completed V2 before the measure was introduced were instead administered this measure at their next available visit.</p>

<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">This measure will need to be complied whenever it was assessed for the original participants. All others after its launch will have the measure at V2. One additional caveat- only people who report alcohol, opioids, cannabis, tobacco or stimulants on the ASSIST during or the 3 months before pregnancy (V1) or the end of pregnancy (V2) are given the instrument.
<p style="color: red;">Luci note: I recommend removing this text as it is not pertinent to QC and the info that it does provide is already described more clearly in other sections. Perhaps replace with something similar to the other SU measures, eg: "Response distributions are reviewed for outliers and additionally cross-checked with ASSIST V1/V2 to ensure consistency in reported substances." </p>

## Instrument Details

If individuals endorse one of 5 substances on the V1 Assist (3 months before or during pregnancy) or the V2 Assist (end of pregnancy), they will complete the questionnaire only for those endorsed substances. For each substance endorsed, they are asked the type of use (e.g. cannabis- smoked flower, vaped, edibles, etc). They then report, on average for each trimester, on average how many weeks they had use, and for each week, the average number of days they had use. See [Additional Exposure Questions PDF](additional-exp-V2.pdf) for example.
