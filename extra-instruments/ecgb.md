# ECGB VSF+BI


## HBCD Modification Details to format/organize

For Early Child Behavior Questionnaire Very Short Form + Behavioral Inhibition (ECGB VSF+BI), Alterations were made to items when the item referred to the child/baby as “s/he” or “her/him”. These pronouns were changed to “the baby/child,” “they/them” as fit the item wording. “Parent” was changed to “parent/caregiver” where appropriate. The creators of the ECBQ-VSF have requested that these alterations be noted in all documentation and publications.
In addition to the gender and caregiver terminology noted above, the HBCD WG and measure experts added a scale to the authors’ original ECBQ Very Short Form. In addition to the overall Surgency, Negative Affect and Effortful Control scales that are derived from the validated ECBQ VSF we added a Behavior Inhibition (or Social Fear) scale using items from the long form of the ECBQ.
