    <i>Many of these questions are about your culture. In this country, people come from a lot of different cultures. There are many words to describe these cultures, such as the culture of your family, a country where you or your family members were born, an ethnicity, or a religion. We refer to these below as your "family culture." While we ALL live in America, when we refer to "American" culture in the following items, we mean cultural practices or traditions that are NOT part of your family's ethnic, religious, or other cultural practices, but that are practiced often as part of "American" culture.</i>
    <br>
    <i>Please select all that apply. If you do not identify with a culture other than American, select "none". If your family culture is not listed, select "None of these apply/My family culture is not listed".</i>
