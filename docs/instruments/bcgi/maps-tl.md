<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">QC procedures involved examination of missingness (by counting the number of items answered for each participant) and age to ensure that it falls within the expected range (3-9 months for Infant version; 10-17 months for Toddlerhood and Preschool version). Summary statistics and visualizations were generated to review item-level frequencies, age, and scores (calculated with application of prorated scoring to account for missing data). Finally, Cronbach's Alpha was calculated to assess reliability.</td></tr>

## Instrument Details

The **Multidimensional Assessment Profiles- Temper Loss scale (MAPS-TL)** is a well-validated survey assessing irritability that serves as a tool for characterizing the developmental expression of early mental health risk. MAPS-TL measures a range of behaviors that encompass dysregulation, responsiveness to environmental input, and context. Questions inquire about the behaviors of the focal child over the past month. Irritability has been identified as an early dimensional marker of lifespan mental health risk. MAPS-TL aims to delineate the typical-to-atypical spectrum of irritability in early childhood and identify those young children at high probability of subsequent adaptational problems based on problems with dysregulation.

<p><b>General Language Modifications</b><br>
Alterations were made to replace ‚Äúparent‚Äù with ‚Äúparent/caregiver‚Äù where appropriate. In addition, measure instructions and individual items that reference gendered pronouns (‚Äòhis/hers‚Äô, ‚Äòhe/she‚Äô) were edited to either eliminate the pronouns entirely or replaced with ‚Äòmy child‚Äô when eliminating pronouns was not grammatically possible. Because the psychometric validation for these measures was done using items from the original measures, future publications should account for and note edits made to individual items.</p>

<p><b>V03</b><br>
Each of the 17 items for MAPS-TL is answered on a scale of 1 to 6: 1 [Never], 2 [Rarely (Less than once per week)], 3 [Some (1-3) days of the week], 4 [Most (4-6) days of the week], 5 [Every day of the week], 6 [Many times each day]. A <strong>summary score</strong> is generated when the caregiver provides a numerical score of 1 to 6 for at least 9 out of the 17 items. If fewer than 9 items are completed, the score is marked as missing. When responses are available for 9 to 16 items, a prorated score is calculated using the formula:
<p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
  \[
  \text{Prorated Score} = \left( \frac{\text{Sum of answered items}}{\text{Number of items answered}} \right) \times \text{17}

</p>
<p><b>V05</b><br>
Each of the 40  items for MAPS-TL is answered on a scale of 1 to 6: 1 [Never], 2 [Rarely (Less than once per week)], 3 [Some (1-3) days of the week], 4 [Most (4-6) days of the week], 5 [Every day of the week], 6 [Many times each day]. A <strong>summary score</strong> is generated when the caregiver provides a numerical score of 1 to 6 for at least 20 out of the 40 items. If fewer than 20 items are completed, the score is marked as missing. When responses are available for 20 to 40 items, a prorated score is calculated using the formula:
<p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
  \[
  \text{Prorated Score} = \left( \frac{\text{Sum of answered items}}{\text{Number of items answered}} \right) \times \text{40}
