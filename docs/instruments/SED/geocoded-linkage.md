# Geocoded Linkage from Home and Work Addresses

The HBCD Study uses geocoded linkage to derive proxy social and environmental measures based on where participants live and receive care. By linking residential and care place addresses to external datasets, we can estimate participants‚Äô cumulative exposure to environmental and socioeconomic factors.

## Release Data

Geocoded linkage data are provided in [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/) format under `hbcd/concatenated/`.     
<i>See the <a href="../../../datacuration/overview" target="_blank">Data Structure Overview</a> to learn more about BIDS and data types.</i>

## Details

maybe something similar to the abstract for [Fan et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2021.101030), except add HBCD-specific information? eg:

Brain development is shaped not only by biological factors, but also by the environments in which children live and grow. To capture these influences, the HBCD Study incorporates geocoded linkage, connecting participants‚Äô residential and care place addresses to external datasets. This approach provides measures of social, economic, and environmental context that may help explain individual differences in development.
