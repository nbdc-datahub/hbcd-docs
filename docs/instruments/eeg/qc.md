# Quality Control Procedures   

## QC Dashboard

After EEG acquisition, quality control checks are performed using [EEG2BIDS Wizard](https://github.com/aces/eeg2bids), a custom MATLAB application installed at all HBCD sites. These checks are immediately provided to the user to ensure the data's integrity and usability. The process includes:

- Verifying event markers in the EEG data to confirm all required events are accurately recorded.
- Ensuring the setup for stimulus presentation and EEG data acquisition adheres to the study protocol.
- Inspecting electrode impedances to ensure they are within acceptable limits.
- Detecting multiple task runs and incomplete recordings.
- Confirming the use of correct E-Prime task versions.

Both study sites and the EEG Core team use an EEG Quality Control dashboard developed by LORIS to access and monitor incoming EEG data and QC metrics, such as retained epochs and line noise levels. Outputs from the HBCD-Maryland Analysis of Developmental EEG ([HBCD-MADE](https://hbcd-made.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) pipeline, which handles preprocessing and data cleaning, are also integrated into the dashboard. These outputs include key metrics like outlier statistics for specific task epochs ([Debnath et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13580)). Regular site-specific check-ins and troubleshooting are conducted to ensure consistent protocol adherence and data quality across sites. For a detailed description of QC procedures in the HBCD Study EEG protocol, refer to [Fox et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101447).

During quality control, a frequently observed issue across all tasks was the irregular application of EEG sensors. Additionally, partial task completion due to infant fussing and missing stimulus flags were commonly noted for the faces and auditory mismatch negativity tasks.

## Stimtracker Artifact Detection

    The <strong>StimTracker</strong> device is used during EEG acquisition for the V03, V04, and V06 protocols. It provides precise timing of auditory or visual stimulus onset and marks the start and end of each task. The EEG Core identified an electrical artifact at stimulus onset and offset, caused by an electrical spike generated by the device. This artifact appears in only a subset of files collected with current HBCD systems.
    </p>
    <p>
    To detect the artifact, the EEG Core developed a custom MATLAB script that averages all epochs per task and flags characteristic voltage fluctuations (>1 µV) in two time windows: –10 to 10 ms and 250 to 270 ms (onset and offset of the voltage spike).

      The artifact is characterized by a negative deflection at stimulus onset and a positive deflection at offset.

Files flagged as containing the artifact in raw EEG data were visually inspected in the processed data. If the artifact remained visible, the file was labeled as containing the StimTracker artifact. If the artifact was not visible after MADE preprocessing, the file was labeled as artifact-free, reflecting sufficient artifact removal.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been generated for the regions of interest for each task. **Based on current evaluation, the StimTracker artifact does not affect ERP latency or amplitude.** Nonetheless, we encourage users to examine potential effects in their own analyses.

## EEG Net Placement ("Capping Quality") Ratings

<div class="table-banner">
  <span class="emoji"><i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i></span>
  <span class="text">Capping ratings are included in the tabulated QC files for each task (<code>eeg_qc_task-&lt;TASK&gt;</code>).</span>
</div>
<p></p>

EEG capping quality ratings are used to determine inclusion in data processing. Photos used to assess EEG capping quality are taken for each acquisition from the front, back, top, left, and right angles of the participant's head and uploaded via the BIDS Wizard application to a secure computing environment. They are then reviewed by the EEG Core at the University of Maryland to rate the quality of EEG net placement, or "capping quality," for each acquisition.
