        <li><strong>Monthly data consistency checks</strong> to identify discrepancies across submissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution of contradictory site responses</strong>, such as inconsistencies in site responses where reported answers about whether a TIC had or had not “ever” occurred conflicted with the information recorded in TIC Screeners. Sites were contacted for clarification and correction.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up on data entry issues</strong>, including missing or incomplete responses, conflicting information across multiple forms, or implausible entries (e.g., erroneous completion at V1 during pregnancy).</li>

## Instrument Details

The **Transitions in Care (TIC) Screener** documents when children spend time living in non-parental care (i.e., change in who provides primary care for the child) and is administered at every time point starting with Visit 2. It is designed to capture children’s formal and informal transitions to non-parental care, including living in foster care, kinship care, and other non-parental care arrangements, either temporary or permanent. The TIC Screener is completed by a research assistant (RA) at each site at the time of scheduling a participant, usually based on phone calls. Information can be entered into the profile of the child, original consented parent, and/or alternate caregiver.

## INTERNAL NOTES (to remove)

**Updates made by Luci when pulling info from README template:**

Below is info from the README that I interpreted as internal documentation and did not include or updated in the page above:

 - pilot data dictionary excluded
 - **For QC**, I combined "QC Procedures" and "Common Issues Identified:" to make it clear to users that the common issues were corrected via QC (as opposed to being issues that will exist in the release data). I also did not include any of the detailed text from "potential issues noted by subject matter experts" as they were already summarized in the text describing QC issues identified (with a level of detail more fitting/relevant for the end user)
 - This text was located under "Additional info" and I originally thought to add it to a Responsible Use Warning, but I believe it is general responsible use (already described elsewhere on the site) as opposed to instrument-specific, so left it out for now:

 "Under the NBDC Data Use Certification agreement (DUC, Terms and Conditions # 5), you agreed NOT to use data from NBDC in a manner that establishes the individual identity of study participants or establishes identities of their relatives. The DUC also prohibits you from publishing or otherwise disseminating derived data that could help identify persons. To help maintain anonymity, you agreed to use a minimum cell threshold of 10 in publications or other public reporting of the data and analyses."

 Let me know if any changes are needed or if a Responsible Use Warning/Data Warning should be added!
