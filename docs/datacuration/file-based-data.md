# Raw BIDS & Processed Derivative File-Based Data

## Raw BIDS

The `rawdata/` folder includes raw <span class="tooltip">file-based<span class="tooltiptext">imaging and biosignal data<br>(varied formats)</span></span> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spectroscopy (MRS), electroencephalography (EEG), and motion/accelerometry (i.e. [wearable sensor](../instruments/sensors/wearsensors.md) recordings for leg motion) data, converted to BIDS and organized under subject and session-specific directories for processing through BIDS App pipelines ([see details](../instruments/processing/index.md)). *Note that the folder and file counts may vary across subjects and sessions, which is expected in a large-scale infant MRI study.*

## Participant-, Session-, & Scan-Level Data
Participant-, session-, and scan-level data are stored in standardized `.tsv` files, accompanied by a `.json` sidecar file that defines the columns and describes the data fields, located in the `rawdata/` directory and its subdirectories:

- **Participant-level**: Stored in `rawdata/participants.tsv`, this file includes basic demographic and participant information (e.g., sex).
- **Session-level**: Stored in `sub-<label>_sessions.tsv` within each subject folder, this file includes session information such as collection site, the participantâ€™s age at each session, and head size.
- **Scan-level**:  Each session folder includes a `sub-<label>_ses-<label>_scans.tsv` file with per-scan information including participant age at scan as well as all raw data QC scores (see [HBCD MR Quality Control Procedures](../instruments/mri/qc.md#location-of-raw-data-qc-results-in-data-release)).

### Fields Reporting Age

See description of fields reporting age under Age Variable Definitions > <a href="../../instruments/agevariables/#raw-file-based-data" target="_blank">Raw File-Based Data</a>.



## Processed Derivatives

The `derivatives/` folder contains derivatives, which are file outputs from <a href="../../instruments/processing/" target="_blank">processing pipelines</a>.
