<p>When using HBCD data, all data users must agree to responsible use as described in the DUC. When conceptualizing studies, analyzing data, and communicating findings from studies that use variables such as race, ethnicity, country of origin, and socioeconomic data, it is critical to consider strategies to avoid stigmatization of any groups and perpetuating harmful biases.</p> 
<p>Race and ethnicity are collected as a part of the HBCD protocol to reflect social experiences (i.e., representing social constructs), and should not be conceptualized as biological, natural, intrinsic, or fixed categories of people. In addition, researchers sometimes use race and/or ethnicity variables as proxies for unmeasured social experiences or environmental exposures. HBCD measures a wide variety of social experiences and environmental exposures. In analyzing HBCD data, race/ethnicity should not be used as a proxy for measured variables.</p>

<p><b>Participant-Reported Challenges</b><br>
Some participants reported challenges in answering certain questions, such as those related to race and ethnicity (e.g. options did not capture how they choose to identify their child).</p> 
<hr>
<p><b>Withheld Variables/Variable Data With Small Cell Sizes</b><br>
Some variables do not contain any data in the current data release (e.g., household roster response options allowed for more household members than were reported by the respondents who completed V04 or V06  to date). These variables are currently being retained, as their relevance may change as data collection proceeds.</p> 
<p>Some variables in this release have small cell sizes (between 1 and ten people per cell).  As a condition of using these data, specified in the DUC, you agree not to identify any individual from whom data was obtained and not to identify their relatives. You agree to a minimum cell threshold of 10 in any public reporting of the data (publications or presentations).</p>

## Instrument Details

Demographic information is crucial for understanding the child’s environment and identifying how social, structural, and economic factors influence development over time in a longitudinal study of child development. **Beginning at Visit 4, there is a child demographic form** that collects information about the child’s background and household environment. It includes questions on the child’s sex at birth, race and ethnicity (with multiple selectable categories to capture diverse identities), and how others classify the child’s race or ethnicity. 

The form also documents the respondent’s relationship to the child, legal guardianship status, and whether the respondent lives with the child, including the number of days per month in shared residence. Additional sections capture detailed household composition, such as the number of adults and children, and request a table listing all individuals who live with the child at least two nights per week, including their age and sex. Additionally, the child form requires the respondent to report the total household income for the past year (note: if the child resides in more than one household, they are asked to provide the average of the household incomes). These data are designed to support a nuanced analysis of the child’s social and family context within the study. See [Cioffredi et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101429) for a detailed description of the HBCD Demographics survey.

Also see [Basic Demographics](../demo/basicdemo.md), which includes variables derived from the HBCD Demographics instruments and data collected during study enrolment/screening.
