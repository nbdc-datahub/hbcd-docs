## Instrument Details

Assessment of children‚Äôs home environments is crucial to understanding contexts and experiences that are important predictors of children‚Äôs development. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory (Caldwell & Bradley, 2016, 2003) is one of the most widely used measures of the quality and quantity of support available to a child in the child‚Äôs home environment. The HOME-21 is a revision of the HOME-Short Form that was used in the NLSY. The HOME-21 includes updates to tool to be responsive to changes in the composition of families, gender roles and the division of childcare in families, norms about the acceptability and advisability of different forms of discipline, and the digital environment in which children live (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pas0001183" target="_blank">Lansford et al., 2023</a>).

<p>The HOME-21 is scored in 2 domains, <i>Cognitive Stimulation (C)</i> and <i>Emotional Support (E)</i> (see NLSY Scale* in table below), plus a total score:</p><br><br>
