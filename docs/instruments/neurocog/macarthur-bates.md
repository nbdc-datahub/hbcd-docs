<p>The CDI forms are well-documented and widely used assessments. We note that percentile scores were calculated based on the norms described in MacArthur-Bates User's Guide and Technical Manual, 3rd Edition (Marchman, Dale, and Fenson, 2023), see additional references below. See <a href="#hbcd-mod">HBCD Modifications</a> for a description of how the CDI-WG is administered to children with exposure to different languages; users may want to consider the Multilingual Language Development questionnaire in conjunction with the CDI.</p>

<p>The CDI-WG provides percentiles score but does not provide standard scores. Note that in some cases, the caregiver endorsed all items in certain sections of the Web-CDI form. These cases are included in the released data as completed by the caregiver, but users may take caution in interpretation.</p>

See https://webcdi.org/static/webcdi/pdf/webCDIManual.pdf for example instructions.2. All data collection, calculation of summary scores and percentile scores is done within Web-CDI and imported into the HBCD database.  Data was reviewed to verify that fields are appropriately labeled upon import, and range checks of all summary variables were completed.</td></tr>

## Instrument Details

The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories, Words and Gestures is a caregiver -report assessment of childrenâ€™s early language development, including expressive and receptive vocabulary and gesture. In HBCD, the Words and Gestures form is administered up to 16 months of age.  Beginning at 16 months of age, the Words and Gestures form the Words and Sentences form. See details about both forms at [https://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/](https://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/).

<p>Administration of the CDI-WG in English or Spanish is decided based on the results of the Multilingual Language Development questionnaire. If the caregiver reports that the child has 30% or greater exposure to English and/or Spanish, they are prompted to complete the CDI in that language; children who are exposed to both English and Spanish at a greater than 30% level are prompted to complete both forms. If caregivers report less than 30% exposure to either language, administration defaults to English.</p>

<p>All summary scores (e.g. Total Gestures, Words Understood, Words Produced) and associated percentiles (with and without adjustment for child sex) were computed within Web-CDI using the most updated norms within that software and described in MacArthur-Bates User's Guide and Technical Manual, 3rd Edition (Marchman, Dale, and Fenson, 2023).</p>  
<p>The childâ€™s age at administration for purposes of scoring the CDI is entered by the caregiver as part of the Web-CDI form. The caregiver also notes on this form if the child was born prematurely and if so, by how many weeks. The Web-CDI then provides percentile scores both unadjusted and adjusted for prematurity. See https://webcdi.org/static/webcdi/pdf/webCDIManual.pdf.</p>
