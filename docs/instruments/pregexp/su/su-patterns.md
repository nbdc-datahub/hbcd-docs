<p>HBCD participants are relying on data users to be respectful and to minimize potential harms (such as stigmatization) when analyzing data and reporting analyses. For a brief discussion of how stigma and stereotyping affect people with substance use disorder, see this National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) website: <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/stigma-discrimination#address">https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/stigma-discrimination#address</a>.  </p>
<p>When using these data, please consider the context in which HBCD collected data on the use of substances. HBCD focuses on the impact of exposures on child development; therefore, substance exposure was assessed rather than the legality of the drug or its misuse. There is a significant difference between the “use” of a substance, which may or may not be legal, and the “misuse” of that substance. It is not, for instance, appropriate to describe participants who used substances as “addicts” or as having a “substance use disorder” because we did not collect information on such diagnoses. A number of drugs for which we gathered data, although open to misuse, could have been prescribed. These include methadone, buprenorphine, Adderall, and even certain cannabis products. While a participant’s use may or may not have been consistent with prescribed indications, we have not collected such information, nor have we collected information addressing the motivation for use.   </p>
<p>For recommended language related to substance use, please see the NIDA website: <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/nidamed-medical-health-professionals/health-professions-education/words-matter-terms-to-use-avoid-when-talking-about-addiction"><i>Words Matter - Terms to Use and Avoid When Talking About Addiction</i></a>.</p>
<p>We suggest that while designing and reporting analyses, users consider additional factors that may be more common among individuals with prenatal substance use and likely affect many outcomes of interest. Data users can minimize potential experimental biases by including appropriate additional variables that assess participants’ other relevant exposures and social contexts. HBCD has collected many such variables, some of which might serve as confounders or modifiers in analyses of substance use variables from this instrument.  </p>
<p>Please take care not to overinterpret your results or to make assumptions about causation if your analysis is not designed for causal inference.  We cannot control how other people, such as policy makers, educators, or clinicians, use the results of our research, but we can minimize risks of misuse by such non-scientist constituencies by being very clear, in papers and presentations, about the limits of our findings. </p>

<p>The SU Patterns in Pregnancy measure is administered only to participants who endorsed substance use on the V1 or V2 ASSIST. Because the measure was added one year after study enrollment began, its availability varies across participants. Most participants completed the measure at V2; however, early enrollees (~1,200 participants) who had already finished V2 before its introduction instead received it at their next available visit.</p>
<p>The form captures general patterns of substance use by trimester and is intended to complement (1) the Timeline Followback (TLFB), which focuses on specific weeks of use during pregnancy, and (2) biospecimen data, which have variable look-back periods. However, some participants only consider <i>use after pregnancy recognition</i> as 'pregnancy use,' which may result in discrepancies between this measure, the ASSIST, and the TLFB.</p>

<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">This measure will need to be complied whenever it was assessed for the original participants. All others after its launch will have the measure at V2. One additional caveat- only people who report alcohol, opioids, cannabis, tobacco or stimulants on the ASSIST during or the 3 months before pregnancy (V1) or the end of pregnancy (V2) are given the instrument.
<p style="color: red;">Luci note: I recommend removing this text as it is not pertinent to QC and the info that it does provide is already described more clearly in other sections. Perhaps replace with something similar to the other SU measures, eg: "Response distributions are reviewed for outliers and additionally cross-checked with ASSIST V1/V2 to ensure consistency in reported substances." </p>

## Instrument Details

If individuals endorse one of 5 substances on the V1 Assist (3 months before or during pregnancy) or the V2 Assist (end of pregnancy), they will complete the questionnaire only for those endorsed substances. For each substance endorsed, they are asked the type of use (e.g. cannabis- smoked flower, vaped, edibles, etc). They then report, on average for each trimester, on average how many weeks they had use, and for each week, the average number of days they had use. See [Additional Exposure Questions PDF](additional-exp-V2.pdf) for example.
