<p><b>General</b><br>
The language of the survey was updated to replace "Native” with “Family” and “Mainstream” with “Other American”.</p>
<p><b>Instructions Modifications</b><br>
The following instruction text was added:<br>
<i>Many of these questions are about your culture. In this country, people come from a lot of
different cultures. There are many words to describe these cultures, such as the culture of
your family, a country where you or your family members were born, an ethnicity, or a
religion. We refer to these below as your "family culture." While we ALL live in America, when
we refer to "American" culture in the following items, we mean cultural practices or traditions
that are NOT part of your family's ethnic, religious, or other cultural practices, but that are
practiced often as part of "American" culture.<br>
Please select all that apply.<br>
If you do not identify with a culture other than American, select "none". If your family culture
is not listed, select "None of these apply/My family culture is not listed".</i></p> 
<p><b>Assessment Items</b><br>
The following item was removed: "I would be willing to marry a person from my native culture."</p>
