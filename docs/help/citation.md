# How To Cite HBCD Data Release Docs

The HBCD Data Release Documentation is version-controlled, allowing researchers to cite and view specific snapshots of the website. Because the documentation is regularly updated, citing the version is useful as it will guide others to the specific material that was consulted.

To cite the current version, visit the most recent release on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15002829). The appropriate citation is listed in the **Citation** box on the right side of the pageâ€”simply copy and paste it into your references.

Note that previous versions of the Release Docs website can be viewed by selecting a version from the flyout menu in the bottom-right corner of the page:

<div class="img-with-text">

    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Opened flyout menu example (source: ReadtheDocs)</i></p>
</div>
