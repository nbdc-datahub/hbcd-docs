# Data Warning: Stimtracker Artifact Details

## Time-Frequency Plots
##### Time-frequency plots (1-30 Hz) of data release subjects at E55 including (<i>left</i>) and excluding (<i>right</i>) subject with artifact:

##### Time-frequency plots arranged by electrode position for subject data with artifact. Note that there is an influence of this artifact in E55 and surrounding electrodes:

## Effects On ERP Derivatives 
##### VEP & FACE Tasks
While the artifact is present at channel E55, it does not appear in the regions of interest (ROIs) for the **VEP** (*left*) and **FACE** (*right*) tasks, as illustrated for the Oz ROI for the subject data with artifact below:

##### MMN Task
For the **MMN** task, the artifact does not appear in the T7/T8 ROI (*left*) because channel E55 is not used. However, the FCz cluster (*right*) includes electrodes E12 and E112, which may be affected by the artifact:
