<b>Additional comments/questions you have about this form</b>:
"This form is different from the other validated/standardized assessments in HBCD. I have no idea what kind of detail is required for the QC (or if it is needed at all). I am not sure the data warnings or the RUD are appropriate or detailed enough. Please advise."

<p>The Study Navigator Contact Form was created for the HBCD Study and is being tested as a valuable document for characterizing participant contacts and support. The form was developed by integrating valuable metrics from documents used in similar support professions such as certified peer support specialists. Use of the form was strongly encouraged, but not mandatory, for the HBCD sites to complete.</p>

## Instrument Details

Recruitment and retention in studies involving pregnant individuals who use substances can be challenged by mistrust due to SUD-related stigma. To address this, the HBCD Study integrates **certified [peer support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/peer-group) specialists, i.e. Study Navigators**, who provide participant-centered support throughout the study. For details on the conceptual framework, core skills, training, and team integration of support professionals, see [Hilliard et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101495).

The **Study Navigator Contact Form** included in the data release captures visit-specific information when participant support is provided. It documents:

- Visit details (date, time, location, scheduling, etc.)
- Support topics discussed
- Actions taken during each contact

Note that the data is not scored. This is descriptive data about the type/provision of Study Navigator supports and contacts.
