## Diffusion-Weighted Acquisitions
Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) refers to the raw image data acquired during scanning. The DWI protocol provides diffusion-weighted images that may be used to estimate multiple models of diffusion behavior in the central nervous system. The protocol acquires roughly 140 diffusion-weighted echo planar images at four b-values (diffusion-weighting) between 0 and 3000 s/mm^2 (12-13 minutes total acquisition time). For raw image acquisition, a minimum of 60% of the diffusion-weighted volumes are required to be collected for the acquisition to be deemed successful. 

The diffusion-weighted images are processed with denoising and Gibbs artifact reduction, and corrected for eddy current distortion, head motion and echo planar susceptibility distortion ([Cieslak et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01185-5)). The diffusion encoding enables the estimation of multiple diffusion MRI models including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Basser et al. 1994), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) ([Jensen et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.20508)), and mean apparent propagator (MAP) ([Özarslan et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.016)). Each of these is described in greater detail below.


## Derived Images
### Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Maps
DTI maps, including **fractional anisotropy (FA)** and **mean diffusivity (MD)**, are commonly used measures that represent the DWI signal using a 3D multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution of water diffusion displacements. The FA of the diffusion tensor represents the degree of anisotropic diffusion. In neural tissues, FA is increased in white matter bundles with dense, parallel fiber orientations. The MD corresponds the directionally-averaged apparent diffusion coefficient of water in the tissue and is inversely related to the density of cellular membranes. 

### Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) Maps
DKI maps, including mean kurtosis (MK), provide commonly used measures that expand the DTI signal model to estimate non-Gaussian diffusion kurtosis behavior in the brain. DKI maps may be used to better represent more complex diffusion-weighted signals phenomena that may be associated with more restricted diffusion. The mean kurtosis (MK) is the directionally averaged kurtosis measure, which is increased in regions of dense white matter.  

### Mean Apparent Propagator (MAP-MRI)
The Mean Apparent Propagator (MAP-MRI) extends DTI to generate a true and proper propagator, i.e. a spatial probability distribution function that indicates the likelihood a water molecule will end up at a given position for a specified diffusion time. Because of its non-parametric nature and lack of any assumptions on this distribution, MAP-MRI can quantify the non-Gaussian character of the diffusion process, therefore, more accurately characterizes diffusion directionality and anisotropy (please refer to [Özarslan et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.016) for details). MAP-MRI includes the following metrics:

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><u>Propagator Anisotropy (PA)</u></p>
**PA** computed with MAP-MRI provides a more accurate metric of anisotropy compared to FA (described above) by relating the entire three-dimensional apparent propagator to a measure of anisotropy. This is accomplished by computing the dissimilarity of a MAP-MRI propagator from its fully isotropic counterpart.  

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><u>Non-Gaussianity (NG)</u></p>
MAP-MRI propagators are described as a summation of basis functions, where the first term is the diffusion tensor. The additional terms describe how the diffusion process deviates from pure Gaussian. The **NG** index provides a normalized magnitude of these terms. NG measures the overall 3D deviation from a tensor, whereas **NGpar** describes the non-Gaussianity along the primary axis of the diffusion (fiber direction in white matter), and **NGperp** defines it along the perpendicular cross-section (more related to restriction).

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><u>Return To Origin/Axis Probability (RTOP & RTAP)</u></p>
As described above, MAP-MRI, in essence, describes a probability distribution function of where a water molecule could travel to within a specified amount of time. **RTOP** measures the probability that the water molecule would return to its original location. For a large cell with no barriers, this probability would be quite low, whereas for a very small cell with impermeable cell membranes, this probably would be significantly larger as the molecule does not have freedom to move farther. Therefore, RTOP is inversely proportional to pore volume. The mean diffusivity metric from the DTI model is known to be directly proportional to the pore volume, therefore, RTOP is a measure of (inverse) diffusivity for more complex diffusion profiles. 

Similar to RTOP, **RTAP** describes the probability of the water molecule to return to the axis of principal diffusion direction (primary eigenvector) and RTPP is equal to the reciprocal of the mean length of the cylinders, therefore inversely proportional to axial diffusivity, for diffusion taking place within coherently oriented cylinders.
