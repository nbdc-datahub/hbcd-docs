# Behavior/Inhibition Task

## HBCD Modification Details to format/organize

The BI observational task is modeled after the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (Lab-TAB) age-appropriate protocol. The goal was to make available a standardized instrument for laboratory assessment of early temperament. However, it is possible for researchers to use La-TAB tasks and scoring and add slight variations in administration, which is common and appropriate. The original citations for the Lab-TAB should be used in all documentation and projects/papers that use data from this task.
