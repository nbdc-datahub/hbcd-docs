<p>Performance of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fourth Edition, reflects the child's developmental status, but various factors might influence the results of the assessment that should be taken into account.</p>
<p>The test was given in the context of a battery of tests and procedures administered to the child and his/her caregiver during the course of an extended visit. Some children may experience fatigue from this and this may have adversely impacted their performance. Ratings of arousal level of the child before and after the assessment may help in identifying situations where the child may have under-performed.</p>
<p>The child's exposure to different languages may also impact their performance. The Multilingual Language Development questionnaire was used to screen for parental preference for the test to be administered in Spanish or English (<i>Spanish language translations used are available upon request</i>). The instrument also documents other language exposures that the child may have. Exposure to languages other than Spanish or English may impact a child's performance. In addition, some items on the test may be impacted by environmental experiences related to the task or items used. In these cases, the test may underestimate the child's developmental status.</p>

<p>Although the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fourth Edition, is a well-established and validated measure of infant development, tests of this nature have historically had limited predictive validity for long-term neurocognitive status.</p>

    <li>Range checks were performed on the data to identify values that were deviant. This was done at the item and cluster level on individual records.</li>
    <li>Mean and range checks were also done on items and summary scores across the overall cohort to assess deviations. These findings informed RA trainings.</li>
    <li>Completion rates were monitored for the overall consortium and at the site level to address any additional training needed.</li>

## Instrument Details

The **Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fourth Edition**, is an established measure of early development that is commercially available. The test provides an estimate of the child's cognitive, language, and motor skills. Within the Language Domain both the child's receptive and expressive communication skills are assessed. Within the Motor Domain, both the child's fine and gross motor skills are assessed. The Social-Emotional and Adaptive Behavior Scales of the test were not used in this study.

Additional details regarding the instrument are available from the publisher - see [here](https://www.pearsonassessments.com/en-us/Store/Professional-Assessments/Cognition-%26-Neuro/Bayley-Scales-of-Infant-and-Toddler-Development-%7C-Fourth-Edition/p/100001996).

<p><b>Administration</b><br>
The test was designed to be administered by trained clinicians, but in HBCD, the backgrounds of those administering the test varied. In some cases, individuals with clinical experience performed these evaluations, but in most cases, the assessment was done by trained RAs. HBCD implemented a rigorous training process to help support valid administrations of the BSID-4. Subject matter experts, who were licensed psychologists with clinical expertise in infant administration and use of the BSID-4, provided group lectures and discussions, hosted office hours for individualized discussions, and met with HBCD staff members across the consortium to support their learning. To achieve certification for the study to perform evaluations, RAs had to submit a video and their QGlobal item-level scoring responses for review by these subject matter experts.</p>
<p><b>Use of Caregiver Questions</b><br>
The use of Caregiver Questions on the BSID-4 was modified. RAs were told to query the caregiver if the child scores less than a 2 on items where a caregiver response is allowed to inform the assessment. The standardized administration manual indicates the use of these questions when the behavior "has not been observed." The manual further states that there is no limit to how many can be used and that these were used in 95% of administrations in the normative sample. The manual indicates that the validity of the assessment would be questioned if there are frequent discrepancies between what is observed and what is reported.</p>
<p><b>Accommodations For Spanish-Speaking Households</b><br>
Modifications were also made to accommodate Spanish speaking households. For caregivers who indicated a preference for the assessment to be done in Spanish, English instructions were translated by a group of experienced Bayley assessors who routinely do Spanish accommodations during their administrations of infants with substantial exposure Spanish language. The translations were then reviewed by the HBCD Spanish Language Committee. Questions regarding the translations were exchanged until discrepancies were resolved. RAs used the HBCD Spanish translations of instructions and caregiver questions during administration for infants whose caregivers opted for a Spanish language test administration. No modifications were done to the scoring of the responses and computation of the associated cluster and standard scores.</p>
