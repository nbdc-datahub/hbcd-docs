## Details

The **Transitions in Care (TIC) Screener** documents when children spend time living in non-parental care (i.e., change in who provides primary care for the child) and is administered at every time point starting with Visit 2. It is designed to capture children’s formal and informal transitions to non-parental care, including living in foster care, kinship care, and other non-parental care arrangements, either temporary or permanent. The TIC Screener is completed by a research assistant (RA) at each site at the time of scheduling a participant, usually based on phone calls (~5 min). Information can be entered into the profile of the child, original consented parent, and/or alternate caregiver. 

## Quality Control
Quality control procedures include the following:

- **Monthly data consistency checks** to identify discrepancies across submissions.
- **Resolution of contradictory site responses**, such as inconsistencies in site responses where reported answers about whether a TIC had or had not “ever” occurred conflicted with the information recorded in TIC Screeners. Sites were contacted for clarification and correction.
- **Follow-up on data entry issues**, including missing or incomplete responses, conflicting information across multiple forms, or implausible entries (e.g., erroneous completion at V1 during pregnancy).
