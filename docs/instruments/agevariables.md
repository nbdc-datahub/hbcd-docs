# Age Variable Definitions

Separate variables reporting age are included in Basic Demographics (global, single-point variables), tabulated data (age variables at time of instrument administration), and file-based metadata (age variables at time of MR/EEG/wearable sensor data acquisition). See details for each below.

## Basic Demographics

Basic Demographics (`sed_basic_demographics`), derived from multiple sources/instruments, includes global, single-point variables that do not vary over time (e.g. gestational age of the child at delivery). Fields reporting age are computed from administrative records collected at screening and include: **Maternal Age at V01 (MAV01)**, **Maternal Age at Delivery (MAD)**, and **Gestational age at delivery (GAD)**.<br>
See full details in **Basic Demographics - [Age, Sex, & Other Variables](demo/basicdemo.md#age-sec-other-variables)**.

## Tabulated & File-Based Data

Age variables are included across both **[tabulated](../datacuration/phenotypes.md)** and **[raw file-based](../datacuration/file-based-data.md#raw-bids)**  datasets to describe the childâ€™s age at the time of data collection.

  <li><i class="fa-solid fa-table"></i> <b>Tabulated data</b>: Age reflects the time of <i>instrument administration</i>.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-solid fa-folder-open"></i> <b>File-based data</b>: Age reflects the time of <i>data acquisition</i> (e.g., MR, EEG, wearable sensors - available within <a href="../../datacuration/file-based-data/#participant-session-scan-level-data">session/scan TSV metadata files</a>).</li>
</ul>

Age variables are available for postnatal visits (V02 and later), except for **Gestational Age at Administration**, which applies only to the prenatal V01 visit.
