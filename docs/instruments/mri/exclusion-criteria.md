# MR Exclusion Criteria

## Raw Data Exclusion Criteria

Acquisition parameters vary by scanner vendor, so inclusion criteria are typically defined as acceptable <b>ranges</b> rather than fixed values. Following BIDS conversion, modality-specific criteria are extracted from BIDS sidecar JSON files and evaluated accordingly. All images are additionally checked to confirm they were acquired using a head coil.

## Exclusion Criteria for Structural & Functional MRI Derivatives

Structural and functional MRI derivatives were evaluated using <strong>BrainSwipes QC</strong>, a web-based quality control tool that collects expert ratings on image quality via visual assessment of standardized reports <i>(see <a href="../qc/#brainswipes" target="_blank">MRI QC Procedures &gt; BrainSwipes</a> for details)</i>. Session data was excluded from the release based on an average BrainSwipes QC score threshold of 0.5:

 - **If structural data (T1w/T2w) failed QC**, then all derivatives for that session (i.e. including both structural and functional outputs) were removed from Infant fMRIPrep (including M-CRIB-S/FreeSurfer derivative folders) and XCP-D.
 - **If only functional data (one or more BOLD runs) failed QC**, then only functional derivatives from Infant fMRIPrep and XCP-D were removed for that session; structural derivatives were retained. This includes the `func/` and `fmap/` folders in Infant fMRIPrep and `func/` folders in XCP-D.
 
###  Interpretation of Missing BrainSwipes QC Scores

#### #1 Unscored Data: V02 Outputs Processed Via Infant FreeSurfer Workflow
BrainSwipes QC results should be present for most if not all participant data with XCP-D outputs with the key exception: **visit V02 processed using infant FreeSurfer for surface reconstruction.** V02 data (acquired from neonates/0-1 months old) was processed through 2 parallel surface reconstruction workflows, detailed under [M-CRIB-S & FreeSurfer Surface Reconstruction Methods](mri-proc.md#m-crib-s-freesurfer-surface-reconstruction-methods). Expert review and preliminary BrainSwipes QC results made it clear that M-CRIB-S produced much higher quality outputs compared to infant FreeSurfer at the neonatal age range (as it is T2w-based), so manual review via BrainSwipes was only performed on a subset of the data (&lt;20%). We further discourage the use of V02 data processed with FreeSurfer for surface reconstruction for analysis - see [Data Warning](mri-proc.md#warning).    

#### #2 Failed Processing: Sessions Missing XCP-D Outputs Due to Incomplete Processing 
BrainSwipes QC is performed on visual reports generated by <strong>XCP-D</strong>, the final stage of structural and functional MRI processing (see <a href="../mri-proc/#structural-functional-mri-processing-overview" target="_blank">Structural & Functional MRI Processing Overview</a>). Session data that fails to process through XCP-D or at an earlier stages do not reach BrainSwipes and therefore will not have associated QC scores. Therefore, if you are using derivatives from earlier processing stages (e.g., BIBSNet or Infant fMRIPrep) for your analysis, we recommend taking note of data missing corresponding XCP-D derivatives and BrainSwipes QC scores, as this may indicate processing failures due to underlying data quality issues.
