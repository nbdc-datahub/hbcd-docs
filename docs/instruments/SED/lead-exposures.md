## Instrument Details

There is no safe level of lead in the blood. Even low levels of blood lead can impact health and development. Children can be exposed through a [variety of sources](https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/risk-factors/children.html). This instrument combines several state-level Childhood Lead Poisoning prevention program screening instruments in order to identify children at high risk of lead exposure. State-specific screening protocols vary, however most states require blood lead testing at specific ages, in specific economic groups, or if they have at least one risk factor for lead exposure (for example living in a house built before 1950, or consumption of specific candies with high potential for lead contamination). 

CDC-recommended lead testing protocols are described [here](https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/testing/index.html). While there are limited available studies, a recent meta-analysis concluded that more than 1 positive answer on the 5-item 1991 CDC screening questionnaire had a pooled sensitivity of 48% and specificity of 58% for identifying venous blood lead level greater than 10 ug/dL1. However, the current blood lead reference value is 3.5ug/dL, which identifies the top 2.5% of US children with the highest blood lead levels. There is no data on how well screening instruments predict lead exposure at this level, or the extent to which multiple positive responses modify sensitivity and specificity.

Incidents of pediatric lead poisoning have previously been linked to consumption of [certain imported candies and food colorings](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00055939.htm), [traditional remedies](https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/prevention/foods-cosmetics-medicines.html), or food storage vessels. The identification of these specific sources in the Lead Exposures questionnaire is based on documented cases of lead poisoning tied to specific products and should not be interpreted as highlighting any group as having particularly high risk as a result of their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that products and sources others than those specifically listed may contain hazardous levels of lead.
