# Overview: Magnetic Resonance Imaging & Spectroscopy

HBCD includes a suite of **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** and **spectroscopy (MRS)** data measures acquired as part of a comprehensive pediatric neuroimaging protocol, meticulously designed to overcome technical challenges of imaging early in life. 

MR data are acquired during visits V02, V03, V04, and V06 across all 27 Study recruitment sites. The current release includes data from V02 and V03 - with the exception of processed structural/functional outputs from [Infant fMRIPrep (Nibabies)](../../datacuration/derivatives.md/#infant-fmriprep-nibabies) and [XCP-D](../../datacuration/derivatives.md/#xcp-d-xcp_d), for which only data from V02 are currently provided. Please see [Quality Control Procedures](qc.md) for a detailed information on MR QC and the following sections for a summary of each modality:
