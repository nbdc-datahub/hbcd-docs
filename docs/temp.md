## What is a growth-oriented lab environment?

A **growth-oriented lab environment** recognizes that everyone is on the same team, meaning each person’s success
contributes to the success of the whole lab. In such an environment, well-being, growth, and achievement are valued. Features
like open communication, trust, and supportive leadership allow individuals to focus, innovate, and collaborate effectively.

Unhealthy dynamics, on the other hand, can harm individuals, drain energy and
resources, and create pressures that may lead to mistakes or unethical behavior.

**When people feel supported, safe, and respected, they do their best work.**
Understanding the features of a growth-oriented lab helps leaders and members
create a space where everyone feels included and valued, while also enabling
teams to work efficiently, solve problems creatively, and reach shared goals.
By fostering both personal well-being and collective productivity, a growth oriented
lab lets everyone thrive while advancing the lab’s mission.
