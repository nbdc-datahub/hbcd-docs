# ScreenQ - Media Use

Addition of “don’t know” impact on scoring

The ScreenQ should not include a summative score if there are missing data. In this case, both decline to answer and don’t know are considered missing. Thus any questionnaire include those answers should not have a summative score calculated and independent researchers can decide how they deal with missingness.
