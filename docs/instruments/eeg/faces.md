# Faces Task [FACE]

The Faces task (v.11.29.23) is used to assess neural activity supporting face and object processing within the first years of life. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are recorded while infants view faces and objects using an oddball task designed to index different stages of processing including attention, perception, categorization, individuation, and memory.

<p>The HBCD EEG data and EEG preprocessing outputs do not contain any personally identifiable information. It is important to consider that potentially stigmatizing conclusions could emerge from the inappropriate use of the EEG data together with available demographic information or questionnaires. Furthermore, all EEG tasks are all passive at the V03 age range and therefore conclusions should not be drawn about behavioral performance.</p> 
<p>Methodologically, there are a number of best practices for responsible data use that will be included with each file. The first is selecting files that maintain a minimum trial threshold recommendation. For each task, there are three levels of quality control thresholds that can be used: (1) our QC thresholds used to provide feedback to sites on each upload, (2) a 30% trial retention threshold (which we use internally to indicate usability of an EEG recording), and (3) the reliability recommendations for each task.</p>
<p><li><b>Threshold recommendations by task:</b></li>
<li>RS - 108 trials</li>
<li>FACE - 15 trials for each condition of interest</li>
<li>MMN - 30 trials for each condition of interest</li>
<li>VEP - 36 trials.</li></p>
<p>An additional consideration for responsible use of the HBCD EEG dataset applies to disproportionate missing data. It is possible that some participant data may be systematically missing from this dataset by virtue of not meeting the QC thresholds. For instance, with infants that are inattentive and prone to fussing out during the EEG recording, more data may be removed from their datasets by our preprocessing scripts. A similar risk holds with participants  who have thick or dense hairstyling and hair texture, which may impact capping success, impedance, and data quality (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-024-00240-y">Adams et al., 2024</a>). The consortium has proactively worked to address this risk by using scheduling procedures that are flexible to participants hairstyling routines and by purchasing 3 long pedestal nets per site in sizes appropriate for the V03, V04, and V06 visits (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-024-00240-y">Adams et al., 2024</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101396">Mlandu et al., 2024</a>). Preliminary analyses indicate that capping quality for visits where the long pedestal net was used have been consistent with capping quality seen for the dataset at large.</p>
<p>It is important to use these data in a manner which takes into account that physical and neurological differences between groups are not necessarily representative of intrinsic qualities of a given demographic  group. Discussions around data patterns should be sensitive to societal factors. In addition, it is important to note that variation within demographic populations is greater than variation across populations. Demographic markers are categorical proxies that cannot capture or explain the causal mechanisms that may account for evident differences.</p>

<b>HBCD EEG Utilities</b>
<p>The EEG Core of the HBCD Data Coordinating Center (HDCC) has developed some helpful tools for extracting summary statistics and trial measures from HBCD EEG release data. We encourage all users to explore these resources at the <a href="https://hbcd-eeg-utilities.readthedocs.io/">HBCD EEG Utilities</a> website.</p>
<br>
<b>Stimtracker Artifact</b>
<p>The MMN, VEP, and FACE task data for one participant included in the data release was found to contain an electrical noise artifact originating from the stimtracker device used for stimulus timing. All other participants' data were checked and confirmed to be artifact-free.</p> 
<p>This artifact is most prominent in electrode E55 between the REF and COM electrodes, but is also visible in surrounding channels. It is time-locked to both stimulus onset and offset: as highlighted in the following EEG trace (MMN auditory oddball task in E55), the artifact presents as a negative deflection at onset and a positive deflection at offset.</p>

ERPs that index different stages of processing are computed as a function of repeated presentation of faces and objects. The ERP components elicited by the Faces task include P1, N290, and P400.

The task consists of 2 blocks:
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Block 1</strong>: 50 trials of upright faces and 50 trials of inverted faces <br />
  <strong>Block 2</strong>: 50 trials of upright faces and 50 trials of objects</p>
</blockquote>

Timing Details:
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stimulus duration</strong>: 500 ms <br />
  <strong>Interstimulus interval</strong>: 600-700 ms <br />
  <strong>Total trial length</strong>: 110-1200 ms</p>
</blockquote>

If the child loses attention, an attention getter may be played to bring the child’s focus back to the task. There are a total of 36 unique images in the set, with women all displaying neutral expressions, included from each of the following self-identifying demographics: Indigenous, Black, White, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and South Asian.
